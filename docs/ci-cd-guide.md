# CI/CD Pipeline Guide
# Sprint 7 Task 3: CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement & Deployment Automation

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the CI/CD pipeline infrastructure for the HA ML Predictor project. The pipeline implements automated testing, building, deployment, and release management with zero-downtime deployment strategies and robust rollback capabilities.

## Pipeline Architecture

### 1. Testing Pipeline (`test_pipeline.yml`)
**Trigger**: All pushes and pull requests
**Purpose**: Comprehensive automated testing and quality assurance

**Jobs**:
- **Code Quality & Security Scan**: Formatting, linting, type checking, security scanning
- **Unit Tests**: Parallel execution across Python 3.11 and 3.12
- **Integration Tests**: Database integration with PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing and performance validation
- **Security Tests**: Security validation and vulnerability assessment
- **Stress Tests**: System stress testing under load
- **Coverage & Quality Gates**: Coverage consolidation and quality enforcement
- **Deployment Readiness**: Pre-deployment validation

### 2. Docker Build & Deploy Pipeline (`docker-build-deploy.yml`)
**Trigger**: Master/main pushes, tags, manual dispatch
**Purpose**: Container building and automated deployment

**Jobs**:
- **Build Images**: Multi-platform Docker builds with security scanning
- **Deploy Staging**: Automated staging environment deployment
- **Deploy Production**: Blue-green production deployment
- **Setup Rollback**: Rollback preparation and safety checks
- **Release Management**: GitHub releases and notifications

### 3. Release Management Pipeline (`release-management.yml`)
**Trigger**: Master/main pushes, manual dispatch
**Purpose**: Semantic versioning and release automation

**Jobs**:
- **Version Detection**: Automatic version calculation from commits
- **Pre-Release Testing**: Critical test validation
- **Create Release**: GitHub release creation with artifacts
- **Trigger Deployment**: Automated deployment pipeline triggering
- **Post-Release Notifications**: Slack/email notifications
- **Release Quality Gates**: Release validation and quality checks

## Deployment Strategies

### 1. Rolling Deployment
**Use Case**: Development and staging environments
**Benefits**: Simple, resource-efficient
**Downtime**: Minimal (brief service interruptions)

```bash
# Manual rolling deployment
./scripts/deploy.sh --environment staging --strategy rolling --version v1.2.3
```

### 2. Blue-Green Deployment
**Use Case**: Production environment
**Benefits**: Zero-downtime, instant rollback capability
**Requirements**: Double resource allocation during deployment

```bash
# Manual blue-green deployment
./scripts/deploy.sh --environment production --strategy blue-green --version v1.2.3
```

**Process**:
1. Deploy new version to "green" environment
2. Health check and smoke test green environment
3. Switch traffic from "blue" to "green"
4. Monitor green environment under load
5. Decommission blue environment

### 3. Canary Deployment
**Use Case**: High-risk production changes
**Benefits**: Gradual rollout with risk mitigation
**Process**: Deploy to subset of instances with gradual traffic increase

```bash
# Manual canary deployment
./scripts/deploy.sh --environment production --strategy canary --version v1.2.3
```

## Rollback Capabilities

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- Health check failures during deployment
- Performance degradation beyond thresholds
- Error rate spikes above acceptable levels
- Manual emergency rollback requests

### Rollback Types

#### 1. Automated Rollback
Triggered automatically when deployment quality gates fail:
```yaml
# In deployment pipeline
- name: "Monitor deployment health"
  run: |
    if ! health_check_passes; then
      trigger_automatic_rollback
    fi
```

#### 2. Manual Rollback
Initiated by operations team:
```bash
# Rollback to previous version
./scripts/rollback.sh --environment production --auto-approve

# Rollback to specific version
./scripts/rollback.sh --environment production --version v1.1.0
```

#### 3. Emergency Rollback
Fast rollback with minimal safety checks:
```bash
# Emergency rollback
./scripts/rollback.sh --environment production --force --auto-approve
```

## Version Management

### Semantic Versioning
The project follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/):
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
- **MINOR**: New features (backward compatible)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backward compatible)
- **PRERELEASE**: Alpha, beta, rc versions

### Automatic Version Calculation
Versions are calculated automatically based on commit messages:

```bash
# Commit message patterns for automatic versioning
feat: add new prediction model          # Minor version bump
fix: resolve database connection issue   # Patch version bump  
BREAKING CHANGE: update API endpoints   # Major version bump
```

### Manual Version Management
```bash
# Show current version information
./scripts/version-manager.sh show

# Bump version by type
./scripts/version-manager.sh bump minor

# Set specific version
./scripts/version-manager.sh set 1.2.3

# Prepare complete release
./scripts/version-manager.sh prepare-release --type minor --auto-commit
```

## Environment Management

### Environment Provisioning
Automated infrastructure provisioning for different environments:

```bash
# Provision staging environment
./scripts/provision-environment.sh --environment staging --provider local

# Provision production environment  
./scripts/provision-environment.sh --environment production --provider aws

# Destroy environment
./scripts/provision-environment.sh --environment staging --destroy
```

### Environment Configurations

#### Development Environment
- **Resources**: Minimal (1 replica, 512Mi memory)
- **Monitoring**: Basic logging only
- **Backup**: Weekly snapshots
- **Security**: Baseline policies

#### Staging Environment  
- **Resources**: Production-like (2 replicas, 2Gi memory)
- **Monitoring**: Full Prometheus + Grafana
- **Backup**: Daily snapshots
- **Security**: Restricted policies

#### Production Environment
- **Resources**: High availability (5 replicas, 4Gi memory)
- **Monitoring**: Full stack with alerting
- **Backup**: Daily + real-time replication
- **Security**: Maximum security policies

```

### 3. Release Workflow
```bash
# 1. Prepare release
./scripts/version-manager.sh prepare-release --type minor

# 2. Push changes
git push origin master && git push origin v1.2.0

# 3. Monitor automated deployment
# 4. Verify production health
# 5. Announce release
```

### 4. Emergency Procedures

#### Emergency Deployment Stop
```bash
# Stop current deployment
docker-compose down

# Verify all services stopped
docker ps
```

#### Emergency Rollback
```bash
# Immediate rollback to last known good version
./scripts/rollback.sh --environment production --force --auto-approve

# Verify rollback success

- **TLS Encryption**: All external communications
- **Ingress Security**: Web application firewall
- **API Authentication**: JWT tokens and rate limiting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Build Failures
```bash
# Check build logs
docker build --progress=plain -t ha-ml-predictor:debug .

# Inspect failed layer
docker run -it <failed-image-id> /bin/bash
```

#### 2. Deployment Failures
```bash
# Check deployment status
./scripts/deploy.sh --environment staging --dry-run

# View container logs
docker logs ha-ml-predictor_ha-ml-predictor_1

# Check health endpoints
curl -v http://localhost:8000/api/health
```

#### 3. Rollback Issues
```bash
# List available versions
./scripts/rollback.sh --list-versions

# Force rollback to specific version
./scripts/rollback.sh --version v1.1.0 --force

# Emergency recovery
./scripts/rollback.sh emergency
```

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable verbose logging
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

# Run with debug flags
./scripts/deploy.sh --verbose --dry-run

# Check system resources
./scripts/provision-environment.sh --environment staging --verbose
```

## Best Practices
