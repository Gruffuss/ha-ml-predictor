Validation Script: Real-time Publishing Integration with TrackingManager

This script validates that the real-time publishing system is properly integrated
into TrackingManager and works automatically without manual setup.

REQUIREMENTS VALIDATED:
1. TrackingManager automatically initializes real-time publishing
2. Predictions are automatically broadcast to real-time channels
3. No manual setup required for real-time functionality
4. System works as part of main workflow
5. Integration follows existing system patterns

Usage:
    python validate_realtime_integration.py
