# Code Quality & Missing Functionality Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented all 6 remaining tasks from the TODO.md "Code Quality & Missing Functionality" section, resolving all F841 unused variable linting errors and enhancing system capabilities.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ Training System Integration (COMPLETED)
**File:** `src/models/training_integration.py:479`
**Variable:** `training_type`
**Implementation:**
- Modified the training configuration system to accept and use the `training_type` parameter
- Enhanced `set_current_profile()` method call to pass `training_type` for specialized handling
- Now properly passes training type (FULL_RETRAIN, INCREMENTAL, ADAPTATION) to configuration system

**Code Changes:**
```python
# Pass training type to configuration system for specialized handling
self.config_manager.set_current_profile(
    training_profile, training_type=training_type
)
```

### 2. ✅ Background Task Management (COMPLETED)
**File:** `src/adaptation/retrainer.py:856`
**Variable:** `retraining_task`
**Implementation:**
- Added the `retraining_task` to the existing background task registry (`_background_tasks`)
- Enables proper background task tracking and cancellation capabilities
- Integrates with the existing task management infrastructure

**Code Changes:**
```python
# Add to task registry for background task management
self._background_tasks.append(retraining_task)
```

### 3. ✅ Time-based Data Filtering (COMPLETED)
**File:** `src/adaptation/tracking_manager.py:976`
**Variable:** `cutoff_time`
**Implementation:**
- Implemented proper database query using `cutoff_time` for recent state changes
- Added SQL query to filter sensor events based on the cutoff timestamp
- Enhanced with room-specific validation triggering
- Added helper method `_check_room_validation_needed()` for processing results

**Code Changes:**
```python
# Query database for recent state changes using cutoff_time
query = """
    SELECT DISTINCT room_id, MAX(timestamp) as last_change
    FROM sensor_events 
    WHERE timestamp >= %s 
    AND state != previous_state
    GROUP BY room_id
    ORDER BY last_change DESC
"""

result = await self.database_manager.execute_query(
    query, (cutoff_time,), fetch_all=True
)
```

### 4. ✅ HMM State Analysis Enhancement (COMPLETED)
**File:** `src/models/base/hmm_predictor.py:130`
**Variable:** `state_probabilities`
**Implementation:**
- Enhanced `_analyze_states()` method to accept and use state probabilities
- Added probability-based metrics for state reliability analysis
- Implemented confidence variance and reliability classification
- Updated logging to include new probability-based metrics

**Code Changes:**
```python
def _analyze_states(self, X, state_labels, durations, feature_names, state_probabilities):
    # Use state probabilities for enhanced state analysis
    state_probs = state_probabilities[state_mask, state_id]
    avg_probability = np.mean(state_probs)
    confidence_variance = np.var(state_probs)
    
    # Calculate certainty metrics using state probabilities
    high_confidence_samples = np.sum(state_probs > 0.8)
    low_confidence_samples = np.sum(state_probs < 0.6)
```

### 5. ✅ Dashboard Response Enhancement (COMPLETED)
**File:** `src/integration/dashboard.py:1616`
**Variable:** `result`
**Implementation:**
- Enhanced alert acknowledgment response to use the `result` from tracking manager
- Added detailed response information based on result type and content
- Improved API response structure with status, acknowledgment details, and metadata

**Code Changes:**
```python
# Enhance response with detailed information from result
if result:
    if isinstance(result, dict):
        response["details"] = result
        response["alert_status"] = result.get("status", "acknowledged")
        response["previous_status"] = result.get("previous_status", "unknown")
        response["acknowledgment_count"] = result.get("acknowledgment_count", 1)
```

### 6. ✅ Enhanced Integration Diagnostics (COMPLETED)
**File:** `src/integration/enhanced_integration_manager.py:801`
**Variable:** `include_logs`
**Implementation:**
- Implemented configurable diagnostic detail levels using `include_logs` parameter
- Added comprehensive log collection for diagnostics when enabled
- Enhanced with connection status, command history, and error tracking
- Added helper methods for status and command history retrieval

**Code Changes:**
```python
# Conditionally include logs based on include_logs parameter
if include_logs:
    diagnostic_data["recent_logs"] = {
        "last_error": getattr(self, "_last_error_message", None),
        "last_error_time": getattr(self, "_last_error_time", None),
        "integration_status": self._get_integration_status_logs(),
        "command_history": self._get_recent_command_history(),
    }
```

## Verification Results
