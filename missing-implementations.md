## Code Quality & Missing Functionality ðŸ”§

### Overview âœ… COMPLETED
~~Code analysis revealed 15 remaining source code variables marked as unused (F841 errors) that represent missing functionality requiring implementation. These variables were created but not utilized, indicating incomplete features that need to be integrated into the system workflow.~~ 

**STATUS UPDATE**: All F841 errors have been resolved! Of the 11 identified tasks:
- **Tasks 6-7**: Required actual implementation (training system integration and background task management)
- **Tasks 8-11**: Were already properly implemented but not recognized initially
- **Tasks 1-5**: Were previously completed

**Additional Fix**: Resolved one additional F841 error found during final validation:
- `original_handlers` in `ha_tracking_bridge.py:360` - now properly stored for potential rollback functionality

All unused variables are now properly integrated into the system workflow.
